# Computaitonal Physics

## Introduction
This repository is a self use program set with several numerical methods and computational physics programs. 

## Experiment
Some experiment data process code. Incluing *hysteresis loop*,*hall effect*,*PN junction*,*RLC*,ect. This part will be updated if necessary.

## Linear Algebra
Including some linear algebra algorithms like LU decomposition, SVD decomposition,ect, written by MATLAB or Python. Some of them are not well coded, but I will keep updating it. 

## HH Model

One of the homework project from our course *Computational Physics 2*. It's a simulation of one neuron's potential change. And we were asked to investigate the change of the potential under different stimulation.  

## Logistic Model
Also a project from the course. The purpose was making us get familiar with the chaotic system.

## Schrodinger Equation
Also a project from the course. We used the method called *Numerove Algorithm* to solve the stationary schrodinger equation which is a parial differential equation. As for the eigenvalue problem, we used the *shooting method*.

##PDE
Including some code now, I might will update some more numerical PDE method. 

## Monte Carlo Method
Still updating

## Practic Articla
Upload my four practical project articles.
